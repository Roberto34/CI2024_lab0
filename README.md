I'm not really good with jokes, so I don't know what to write. I'll try anyway:

I can't wait to enter the professor's house and make him a cup of coffee. One question only: will he give me the keys?

P.S. Also yes, this was written at 00:20 of the day before the deadline. I have a bad problem of procrastination...
